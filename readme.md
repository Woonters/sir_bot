## Overview

A TTS bot for discord utilising [NovelAI](https://novelai.net) text to speech voices.

This is generally designed to only run on some personal private discord servers with a couple of friends
Therefore there isn't a huge provision for sharding / dealing with multiple servers using it at once. 
[Serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) does handle sharding etc. so upgrading to work across
more servers is possible, and a future goal, if only for practicing coding. 

### A Note on TTS 

NovelAI's TTS is a very open API, it doesn't require setting up an account and is surprisingly easy
to utilise, I would suggest taking care when using it, you get 100 free generations and can get through
them quite quickly. Beyond that it's good manners not to abuse public APIs that are useful and cool :)

### A Note on RTVS 

This bot is *HEAVILY* inspired by the blue gnome from [HLVRAI:Alyx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaHrneT9BfU)
As far as I can tell Trog (one of the members) wrote a bot to do the exact 
same thing. That set of streams is why in particular it defaults to using "aHaleAndHeartySir" as the voice.
Please go check them all out, they are cool and funny and generally a delight. 

## How to Use

Download a copy of the bot (I will make releases in the future)
```sh
> git clone https://github.com/Fritzbox2000/sir_bot.git
```
Set a discord bot ID token in the environment 
```
DISCORD_TOKEN="..."  
```
This token is generated when you create the bot, you can only look at it once before you have to re-generate it 
so make sure to write it down somewhere

Edit `prerecordedtable_example.toml` with user ID's and audio clips 
and then rename it to:
`prerecordedtable.toml`

Then build and run 
```sh
cargo run
```

Logging is now available! personal preference means I run:
```sh
RUST_LOG="sir_bot=info" ./sir_bot 
```
logging levels are: 
1. error
2. warn
3. info
4. debug
5. trace

Removing `sir_bot=` will output logging for serentiy and a bunch of other crates I am using 
which might be useful but mainly only for dev-work. 


## TODO / Dev work

TODOs:
- Lots of pictures of gnomes that cycle
- An internal voice to fall back on since I can run out of generations / more voices 
- Editable join and leave messages 
- Play YouTube videos
- Pause, Stop etc. controls
- Play music from my library maybe?
- trace level logging
- test suite (more for github actions than anything else)
